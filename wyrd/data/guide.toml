[envision]
title = "Step 1: Envision the Current Situation"
content = """[bold]ENVISION[/bold] means describing the fiction — what's happening in your story.

[bold cyan]What to do:[/bold cyan]
  • Describe what your character sees, hears, and experiences
  • Write about what your character is doing or attempting
  • Add details about the environment, NPCs, or situation
  • Follow up on the results of your last move

[bold cyan]How to do it:[/bold cyan]
  • Just type — no command prefix needed
  • Your words become your journal entries
  • Write as much or as little as you want

[bold cyan]Example:[/bold cyan]
  > I push through the airlock into the derelict station.
  > Emergency lights flicker. The air smells of rust and decay.
  > I need to find the main computer core to recover the data.

[bold yellow]Tips:[/bold yellow]
  • Fiction comes first — always describe before rolling
  • When uncertain about details, use [cyan]/oracle[/cyan] to answer questions
  • When you take risky action, use [cyan]/move[/cyan] to resolve it"""

[oracle]

content = """[bold]ASK THE ORACLE[/bold] when you need answers about the world.

[bold cyan]When to use:[/bold cyan]

[bold yellow]Tips:[/bold yellow]
  • Ask specific questions, let the oracle answer

title = "Step 3: Make a Move"
content = """[bold]MAKE A MOVE[/bold] when your action or the situation triggers it.

[bold cyan]When to use:[/bold cyan]

  Example: [cyan]/move face danger[/cyan]

[bold cyan]Common moves:[/bold cyan]

[bold cyan]How moves work:[/bold cyan]
  1. Choose your stat (Edge, Heart, Iron, Shadow, Wits)
  2. Roll action die (d6) + stat + any bonuses
  3. Compare to two challenge dice (d10s)
  4. Outcome determines what happens next

[bold yellow]Tips:[/bold yellow]
  • Read the move text carefully
  • Choose the most relevant stat for the situation
  • Don't roll unless the move triggers
  • Follow the outcome text for results"""

[outcome]
title = "Step 4: Interpret Outcomes"
content = """[bold]OUTCOMES[/bold] determine what happens after you make a move.

[bold blue]STRONG HIT[/bold blue] [blue]✓✓[/blue]
  • Your action score beats BOTH challenge dice
  • You succeeded and are in control
  • You get what you wanted
  • [bold]You[/bold] decide what happens next
  • Often gain +1 momentum

[bold magenta]WEAK HIT[/bold magenta] [magenta]✓✗[/magenta]
  • Your action score beats ONE challenge die
  • You succeeded, but with a cost or complication
  • You get what you wanted, but...
  • The [bold]situation[/bold] complicates
  • Follow the move's weak hit text

[bold red]MISS[/bold red] [red]✗✗[/red]
  • Your action score beats NEITHER challenge die
  • You failed or face a dramatic turn
  • Things get worse
  • Pay the Price (lose resources, face danger)
  • The [bold]fiction[/bold] determines what happens

[bold yellow]MATCH[/bold yellow] (Challenge dice are equal)
  • Something unexpected happens
  • Twist, opportunity, or complication
  • Works with any outcome type
  • Add dramatic flair to the result

[bold cyan]After an outcome:[/bold cyan]
  1. Read the move's outcome text
  2. Describe what happens in the fiction
  3. Adjust any tracks ([cyan]/health, /momentum, /supply[/cyan], etc.)
  4. Return to Step 1: Envision what happens next

[bold yellow]Tips:[/bold yellow]
  • Always describe the outcome in the fiction first
  • Mechanical effects follow fictional description
  • Weak hits and misses drive the story forward
  • Momentum burn ([cyan]/burn[/cyan]) can upgrade outcomes"""

[sector]
title = "Build a Starting Sector (pp. 114–126)"
content = """[bold]BUILD A STARTING SECTOR[/bold] prepares the area of space where your campaign begins.
Allow about 30–45 minutes. Work through each step in order.

[bold cyan]STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING REGION[/bold cyan]
  Pick one — this drives settlement counts, encounter tables, and passage counts:

  [bold]Terminus[/bold]   — Settled space. Common communities, well-charted routes.
                 [dim]Best if you want to focus on people and politics.[/dim]
  [bold]Outlands[/bold]   — Frontier. Scattered settlements, perilous navigation.
                 [dim]Best if you want a wild spacer feel.[/dim]
  [bold]Expanse[/bold]    — Deep unknown. Few pioneers, uncharted and dangerous.
                 [dim]Best if you want lonely exploration.[/dim]

  Note your region — you'll need it for steps 2, 3, and 7.

[bold cyan]STEP 2: DETERMINE NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS[/bold cyan]
  Fixed by your region:
  Terminus → 4 settlements   Outlands → 3 settlements   Expanse → 2 settlements

[bold cyan]STEP 3: GENERATE EACH SETTLEMENT[/bold cyan]
  For each settlement, roll all of these:

  [cyan]/oracle settlement_name[/cyan]                  — What is it called?
  [cyan]/oracle settlement_location[/cyan]               — Planetside / Orbital / Deep Space
  [cyan]/oracle population_terminus[/cyan]               — (or outlands / expanse)
  [cyan]/oracle settlement_authority[/cyan]              — Who's in charge?
  [cyan]/oracle settlement_projects[/cyan]               — Roll 1–2 times: what drives this place?

  Write name, location, population, authority, and project(s) as a short note.
  Example: [dim]Bleakhold (Orbital) — Pop: Hundreds — Auth: Corrupt — Mining, Black market[/dim]

[bold cyan]STEP 4: GENERATE PLANETS[/bold cyan]
  For each Planetside or Orbital settlement, roll:

  [cyan]/oracle planet_class[/cyan]                      — What kind of world?

  Give the planet a name if you like (see planet type name tables, pp. 308–318).
  Add the planet type to your settlement note.

[bold cyan]STEP 5: GENERATE STARS (optional)[/bold cyan]
  For each settlement, roll if you want atmospheric detail:

  [cyan]/oracle stellar_object[/cyan]                    — What star do they orbit?

  A corrupted star or impending supernova can shape your opening situation.

[bold cyan]STEP 6: CREATE A SECTOR MAP[/bold cyan]
  Sketch a simple hex grid. Place each settlement as a dot or symbol:
    ⊕ Planetside settlement    ⊙ Orbital settlement    □ Deep Space settlement

  Keep it loose — the map tracks connections, not literal distances.

[bold cyan]STEP 7: CREATE PASSAGES[/bold cyan]
  Passages are charted routes between settlements or to neighboring sectors.
  Fixed by region:
  Terminus → 3 passages   Outlands → 2 passages   Expanse → 1 passage

  Each passage must either connect two settlements or reach the sector edge.
  Draw them as lines on your map.

  [bold yellow]Why passages matter:[/bold yellow]
  • [bold]On a passage[/bold]: use [cyan]/move set a course[/cyan] — single roll, faster travel
  • [bold]Off a passage[/bold]: use [cyan]/move undertake an expedition[/cyan] — harder, but you earn XP
    and can blaze a new passage when complete

[bold cyan]STEP 8: ZOOM IN ON ONE SETTLEMENT[/bold cyan]
  Pick the settlement most interesting to you. Roll:

  [cyan]/oracle settlement_first_look[/cyan]              — Roll 1–2 times: what's the vibe?
  [cyan]/oracle settlement_trouble[/cyan]                 — What's the local problem?

  If it's Planetside or Orbital, also roll for the planet:
  [cyan]/oracle descriptor focus[/cyan]                   — Atmosphere, feature, or hazard

  Note anything evocative in your journal.

[bold cyan]STEP 9: CREATE A LOCAL CONNECTION[/bold cyan]
  You have one connection at campaign start — an important NPC relationship.
  [bold green]Make a Connection is an automatic strong hit. No dice needed.[/bold green]

  Roll to build them out:
  [cyan]/oracle given_name[/cyan]                         — Their name (or /oracle callsign)
  [cyan]/oracle role[/cyan]                              — Their duty or expertise
  [cyan]/oracle character_goal[/cyan]                    — What do they want?
  [cyan]/oracle character_first_look[/cyan]              — How do they present?
  [cyan]/oracle character_aspect[/cyan]                  — A revealed trait (optional)

  Assign them a rank: Troublesome or Dangerous is right for a starting connection.
  Choose one of your settlements as their home.
  Note them on your connections worksheet or journal.

[bold cyan]STEP 10: INTRODUCE A SECTOR TROUBLE[/bold cyan]
  Roll for the sector-wide threat or situation:

  [cyan]/oracle sector_trouble[/cyan]                     — What shadow hangs over this region?

  Envision how this trouble might manifest and note it in your journal.

[bold cyan]STEP 11: NAME THE SECTOR[/bold cyan]
  Roll both and combine:

  [cyan]/oracle sector_name_prefix sector_name_suffix[/cyan]

  Example results: [dim]Fallen + Maw → "The Fallen Maw"[/dim]
                   [dim]Crimson + Drift → "Crimson Drift"[/dim]

  Write the name on your sector map. Your starting sector is ready.
