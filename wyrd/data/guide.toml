[bold cyan]What to do:[/bold cyan]
  • Describe what your character sees, hears, and experiences

  • Write as much or as little as you want

[bold cyan]Example:[/bold cyan]
  > I push through the airlock into the derelict station.
  > Emergency lights flicker. The air smells of rust and decay.
  > I need to find the main computer core to recover the data.

[bold yellow]Tips:[/bold yellow]

[bold cyan]How moves work:[/bold cyan]
  1. Choose your stat (Edge, Heart, Iron, Shadow, Wits)

[bold yellow]Tips:[/bold yellow]
  • Read the move text carefully
  • Choose the most relevant stat for the situation
  • Don't roll unless the move triggers
  • Follow the outcome text for results"""

[bold yellow]MATCH[/bold yellow] (Challenge dice are equal)

  • Add dramatic flair to the result

[bold cyan]After an outcome:[/bold cyan]

  3. Adjust any tracks ([cyan]/health, /momentum, /supply[/cyan], etc.)
  4. Return to Step 1: Envision what happens next

[bold yellow]Tips:[/bold yellow]
  • Always describe the outcome in the fiction first
  • Mechanical effects follow fictional description
  • Weak hits and misses drive the story forward
  • Momentum burn ([cyan]/burn[/cyan]) can upgrade outcomes"""
