## Why Archive These?

These documents capture valuable historical context:

- **Decision-making process** - Why certain choices were made at specific points
- **Project evolution** - How the project grew from POC to production
- **Lessons learned** - Testing results and insights from early development

However, they're **dated snapshots** and should not be used as current project status.
