## Unreleased

### Features

- **Choose Your Truths wizard** — Interactive campaign setup that guides players through establishing 14 fundamental truths about their version of the Forge
  - `/truths` command launches step-by-step wizard
  - Choose from 3 options per category, roll randomly, or write custom truths
  - Truths are displayed in character sheet and exported in session journals
  - All 14 truth categories from the Starforged rulebook included

### Breaking Changes: Package Rename

**The package has been renamed from `starforged` to `soloquest`** to better reflect its purpose as a multi-system solo journaling CLI rather than being tied to a specific game.

#### What Changed
- CLI command: `starforged` → `soloquest`
- Package name: `starforged-cli` → `soloquest`
- Environment variable: `STARFORGED_ADVENTURES_DIR` → `SOLOQUEST_ADVENTURES_DIR`
- Default directory: `~/starforged-adventures/` → `~/soloquest-adventures/`
- Config directory: `~/.config/starforged/` → `~/.config/soloquest/`

#### Migration Guide

**For users with the default directory:**
```bash
# Option 1: Rename your existing directory
mv ~/starforged-adventures ~/soloquest-adventures

# Option 2: Point to existing location
export SOLOQUEST_ADVENTURES_DIR="$HOME/starforged-adventures"
```

**For users with custom directory:**
```bash
# Update your environment variable
# Old: export STARFORGED_ADVENTURES_DIR="/path/to/adventures"
# New:
export SOLOQUEST_ADVENTURES_DIR="/path/to/adventures"
```

**Note:** Your game data files (saves, sessions, journals) are fully compatible - only the directory location reference changes.

### Added
- **Configurable Adventures Directory** — All adventure data (saves, sessions, journal) now defaults to `~/soloquest-adventures/` instead of the CLI repo directory
- Environment variable `SOLOQUEST_ADVENTURES_DIR` to customize where adventures are stored
- Adventures directory location displayed on startup
- Documentation: `docs/user-guide/adventures-directory.md` with configuration guide and Obsidian integration examples

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Adventure files moved from local `saves/`, `sessions/`, `journal/` to `~/soloquest-adventures/` by default
- Session export filenames now include optional title slug: `session_001_first_mission.md`
- Journal files follow naming convention: `{character_slug}_journal.md`

### Benefits
- Integrate with personal wikis (Obsidian, Logseq, etc.)
- Version control adventures separately from CLI
- Upgrade CLI without touching adventure data
- Switch between multiple campaign directories
